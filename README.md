# LMC
## Intro
Little man computer (LMC) is a simple model of a computer that is generally used for learning purposes. When I first read about LMC I tought that programming my own simulator would be a fun exercise. Simulator is mostly based on [Wikipedia entry of LMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer).  My simulator also has a functional assembler that supports mneumonics and labels for ease of programming. 

## Instructions
Instructions consist of 3 digit decimal numbers where first digit generally stands for instruction to execute and last two digits stand for memory address that are used with instruction. 

## Memory
Memory consists of 100 slots of 3 digit decimal numbers. The same memory is used for both instructions and memory.
